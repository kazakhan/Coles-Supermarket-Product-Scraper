# Coles-Supermarket-Product-Scraper
Python code to scrape Coles supermarket

This is a simple python script to scrape the website for the Australian supermarket Coles. It grabs the Product Description, Price and link and saves it to a CSV file for each category. The script fails at the Liquor category and subsequently doesn't scrape the Tobacco category either, I'll get around to sorting that out one day... maybe :)
