Python code to scrape Coles supermarket

This is a simple python script to scrape the website for the Australian supermarket Coles. It grabs the Product Description, Price, product code and link and saves it to a CSV file for each category. The script now gets the liquor category with a three second wait on each page, much slower but more reliable. 
The Tobacco category has an age restriction pop-up that I'm not interested in overcoming.
