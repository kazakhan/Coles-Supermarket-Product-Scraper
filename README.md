# Coles-Supermarket-Product-Scraper
Python code to scrape Coles supermarket

This is a simple python script to scrape the website for the Australian supermarket Coles. It grabs the Product Description, Price and link and saves it to a CSV file for each category. The script stops at the Tobacco category because of an age restriction pop-up that I'm not interested in overcoming.
